# Search-Based Software Engineering Course WS21/22

For now, the Jupyter notebooks are provided as is, and you will have to download and open them in Jupyter. Here's [how to install jupyter notebook on your machine](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).


## Chapter 1: Random and Local Search

The first chapter covers the coding examples from the first two weeks, on basic random search and local search algorithms.

## Chapter 2: Evolutionary Search (Part 1)

This chapter covers basic evolutionary strategies and genetic algorithms.

## Chapter 3: Multi-Objective Optimisation (Part 1)

This chapter covers the basics of Pareto optimality, NSGA-II, and comparison
of multi-objective search algorithms.

## Chapter 4: Multi-Objective Optimisation (Part 2)

This chapter covers several alternative multi-objective search algorithms:
A random baseline, PAES, SPEA2, TwoArchives, and SMS-EMOA.

## Chapter 5: Evolutionary Search (Part 2)

This chapter looks into the various search operators of a genetic algorithm:
Survivor selection, parent selection, crossover, mutation, and the
population itself.

## Chapter 6: Search-based Test Generation (Part 1)

This chapter looks at how the problem of test input generation can be cast
as a search problem, and how to automatically instrument programs for
fitness generation. 

## Chapter 7: Search-based Test Generation (Part 2)

This chapter continues whole test suite generation, and then moves on to
many objective optimisation for test generation.

## Chapter 8: Genetic Programming (Part 1)

This chapter introduces classic genetic programming for scenarios assuming
type closure, and applies this to symbolic regression.

## Chapter 9: Genetic Programming (Part 2)

This chapter continues genetic programming by optimising spectrum-based
fault localisation, grammatical evolution, and automated program repair.
